Pages Per Day
=============

![Pages Per Day](https://raw.github.com/laudenberg/pages-per-day/master/screenshot.png)

You need to write a certain number of pages with a deadline? Pages Per Day adds a little extra panic by calculating the amount of pages you need to write every day upto the deadline. Automatically reloads the PDF to get the current number of pages written.

Installation

If you're feeling lucky, simply type `make`.
